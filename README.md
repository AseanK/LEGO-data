# LEGO Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on LEGO, utilizing Python's pandas and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. The project explores various aspects of LEGO, including color parts, themes, sets, and years. The analysis covers data spanning from 1949 to 2023, providing a comprehensive view of LEGO's evolution over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis comprises a wide range of LEGO-related information, collected from multiple sources. It includes details such as color parts, themes, sets, and years. The dataset is structured and organized to facilitate easy analysis and visualization.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- pandas library
- matplotlib.pyplot library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
